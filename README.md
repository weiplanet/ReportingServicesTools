# Reporting Services PowerShell
SQL Server Reporting Services PowerShell utilities 

## Synopsis

This project contains PowerShell scripts that allows you to perform various operations with SQL Server Reporting Services and Power BI Report Server. In order to use the scripts included in this project successfully, please download/clone the entire project as there are dependencies between the scripts. 

All of our scripts were written with the assumption that you will be executing them against SQL Server 2016 Reporting Services default instance (i.e. mssqlserver). However, we understand this may not be the case for you. So for each script, you will see that we have provided a way for you to specify the name and/or version of your SQL Server Reporting Services or Power BI Report Server instance name. Sometimes the version of your SQL Server instance is also required. If you do not provide one, we will assume that you want to execute this against the default instance.   

## PowerShell Version
Please ensure you're running PowerShell version 3.0+
```powershell
$PSVersionTable
```

## Install
```powershell
Invoke-Expression (Invoke-WebRequest https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/ReportingServicesTools/master/Install.ps1)
```
or
```powershell
Invoke-Expression (Invoke-WebRequest https://aka.ms/rstools)
```
or
```powershell
Install-Module -Name ReportingServicesTools
```

## SQL Server Versions

Some of the commands listed above allow you to optionally specify the version of your SQL Server Reporting Services instance. The following is a list of versions associated to each SQL Server Reporting Services release.

|SQL Server Release|Version|
|------------------|-------|
|SQL Server 2012|11|
|SQL Server 2014|12|
|SQL Server 2016|13|
|SQL Server 2017|14|

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project was to help users perform SQL Server Reporting Services operations via the command line. 

## API Reference

All of the APIs used by this project are publicly available. There are 2 types of APIs used in this repository: SOAP and WMI. You can find more details about the SOAP API at https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms154052.aspx and the WMI API at https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms152836.aspx. In general, you will use SOAP API for operations you would perform using Report Server and Web Portal whereas you will use WMI API for operations you would perform using Reporting Services Configuration Manager. 

## Local testing and development

To verify the versions installed
```powershell
Get-Module -ListAvailable | where Name -eq "reportingservicestools"
```

After you clone the repo you can make local changes and install them in your local machine with
```powershell
Remove-Module ReportingServicesTools
Import-Module .\ReportingServicesTools.psd1
```

For debugging you can set the verbose logging with `$VerbosePreference = "continue"`

## Test

For running tests locally you need a local default instance of  SQL Server Reporting Services and Pester

To install Pester execute
```powershell
Install-Module -Name Pester
```

To excute the tests run (this will execute the CatalogItems test only which doesn't change the local Reporting Services Installation)
```powershell
.\Test.ps1
```

## Style Guidelines

If you have any scripts you would like to share, we request you to please format your scripts according to the guidelines created by the team behind the DSC Resource Kit. (https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResources/blob/master/StyleGuidelines.md) and the PowerShell verbs https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms714428(v=vs.85).aspx
